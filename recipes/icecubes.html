        <p>Here we are, learning how to cook ice cubes. If you're feeling like a particularly bougie degenerate, this one is for you.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><li>Water</li>
        <li>Ice cube tray</li>
        <li>Freezer</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p> Take ice cube tray and hold it under the faucet. <br>
            Turn on the faucet and begin to fill the ice tray. If needed, refer to the <a href="./tapwater.html">cup of water</a> recipe as it will refresh your memory about this process.<br>
            Continue running the faucet until the ice tray is full.<br>
            Once the ice tray is filled, turn off the faucet.<br>
            Place the ice cube tray in the freezer and let it marinate for around 6 hours.<br>
            After the ice cubes are frozen solid, you can now add them to a wide variety of drinks, such as <a href="./tapwater.html">cup of water</a> or <a href="./whiterussian.html">white russian.</a><br>
            Use your imagination! Put ice cubes in all drinks which you want to remain cold!
