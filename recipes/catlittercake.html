        <h2>Directions</h2>
        This cake is a bit intense, but results in a true Degenerate delicacy.<br>
        Prepare cake mixes and bake according to box instructions, using 9" x 13" pans. Let cool after cooking is finished.<br>
        Make pudding according to box instructions. Once completed, cover bowl in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator.<br>
        Place vienna finger cookies in bag and crush with rolling pin until there's nothing but crumbled pieces.<br>
        Set aside 1/4 cup of cookie crumbs. Add a few drops of green food dye to the 1/4 cup and mix with fork.<br>
        Remove finished cakes from pans and crumble them into a large bowl.<br>
        Toss cake with half the remaining crush vienna finger cookie crumbs, along with the chilled pudding.<br>
        Mix gently with cake crumbs until evenly moist.<br>
        Put mixture into the "new" litter box, which somehow got lined with plastic wrap at some point...come on, keep up.<br>
        Unwrap tootsie rolls and microwave 3 of them for 30 seconds at a time on plate until soft. Once soft, taper them to look like cat shits.<br>
        Repeat tootsie roll cat shit project until you have enough cat shits to place throughout your cake.<br>
        Sprinkle remaining half of cookie crumbs over the top of cake. Then, scatter green cookie crumbs over top, which should resemble cat litter.<br>
        <br>
        Bring this cake to a friends birthday party to lose all friends, or eat in public if you're curious to feel how soft those padded walls really are.<br>
