        <h1>Classic White Russian</h1>

        <p>This is the Degenerate Recipes version of a milkshake and it is absolutely delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vodka</li>
            <li>Kahlua</li>
            <li>Cream or Milk</li>
            <li>"Lowball" or "rocks" glass ~ 6-8 oz</li>
            <li>Ice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            First things first, let's gather all of our ingredients for easy drink construction.<br>
            Now we will set up our rocks glass with a few ice cubes. Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with cooking ice cubes, we cover that <a href="./icecubes.html">here</a> as a little bonus.<br>
            We are going to now add together our ingredients starting with vodka and kahlua. The recipe calls for:
            <ul>
                <li>2 parts vodka</li>
                <li>1 part kahlua</li>
                <li>1 part cream</li>
            </ul>
            Pour 2 oz of vodka and 1 oz kahlua over ice into the glass.<br>
            Add 1 oz of cream, or milk, on top of the liquor and ice mixture.<br>
            Okay, so the groovy part is lightly stirring the drink to get a swirl effect, similar to the picture at the top of our page.<br>
            Ideally, for stirring, we should use a straw. If for some reason all of our straws are unavailable ;) just use a finger.<br>
            Honestly, what else did you expect from a website called "Degenerate Recipes"? This ain't a classy joint. <br>

         <h3>Proceed to consume drink, repeat process, and blackout as needed.</h3>
