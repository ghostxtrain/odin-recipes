        <h1>Classic Tap Water</h1>
        <img src="../images/glassofwater.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="Water">
        <p>Perhaps the most essential of all Degenrate Cuisine is the glass of tap water.<br>
        This dish is easy to cook, even for beginners or children, and will cost next to nothing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cup (glass or plastic)</li>
            <li>Sink</li>
            <li>Ice cubes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Acquire cup or drinking glass.<br>
            Find the nearesr sink; preferably kitchen sink but bathroom sink will also work in a pinch.<br>
            Raise cup to just below the faucet of the sink and turn the knob labeled "C" clockwise.<br>
            <strong>Note:</strong>You may find that some sinks have levers as opposed to knobs, in this case, raise lever and test in which direction it should be placed for desired temperature of drinking water.<br> 
            This step can be tricky being that no matter the direction, it will be cold at first, but could eventually turn into a scorching flow of third degree burns within seconds. <br>
            Fill cup until it is about 3/4 full and turn off the faucet.<br>
            <em>Optional -</em> you may add <a href=./icecubes.html>ice cubes</a> at any point while the faucet is off, or I guess on if you decide that you're up for a challenge.<br>
            Now what you should be left with is a nice, cold and refreshing, glass of water...<br>
            unless you're some type of maniac who prefers to drink warm or hot plain water, then I dunno what to tell you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
            <h3>Good job, feel free to hydrate as aggressively as desired!</h3>
