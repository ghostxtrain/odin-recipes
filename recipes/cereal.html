        <p>This dish may not be the breakfast of <em>actual</em> champions, however, this B.O.C is a <strong>staple</strong> of Degenrate Cuisine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul><li>Cereal of your choice</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Standard Bowl</li>
        <li>Spoon (ideally a <em>clean</em> spoon)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Pepare ingredients by organizing on a flat surface, such as a kitchen counter.<br>
        First, we will add the desired amount of cereal to our bowl. <br>
        Next, we will add our milk at a ratio of of 55% cereal to 45% milk. Feel free to experiment with a milk to cereal ratio which you find desirable.<br>
        Once we have determined our ideal milk to cereal ratio, it is time to add the spoon to the bowl.<br>
        With all of our ingredients forming the B.O.C, we are now free to migrate to the couch and binge watch cartoons while we eat.<br>
        <strong>Optional:</strong> Add sugar if your B.O.C needs a bit of a flavor kick or if you need that sweet sugar rush.<br></p><br>
