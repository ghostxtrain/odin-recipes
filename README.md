Odin Project Recipes
Creating a very basic HTML website for Odin Project. 
This webpage will include links, images, lists and possibly other simple HTML elements.

<!--self reflection:
As of right now, I am still referring to the notes I have taken throughout the course but have learned the very basics of HTML including the use of HTML boilerplate, adding images, links, and a few ways of differentiating text on a webpage (em,strong,h1-6). Still getting used to Linux command line and GitHub is a bit tricky but whatever. You got this.-->
